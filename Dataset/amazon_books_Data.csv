And after another 10 or 20 pages, I was sure. And I was right. So much for suspense. The best I could say about this book is that it is okay. Just barely. It's a long book -- unnecessarily long -- and when the author hasn't taken the trouble to craft her plot in a suspenseful way, there's not a lot there to make you want to turn the page. I have mixed feelings about her main character, who was supposed to have been a vibrant, energetic, assertive woman, yet became weak and submissive to her manipulative husband. It's hard for any reader to identiify with that. Additionally, the romance in the book isn't all that interesting -- just two people who are attracted to each other. No real getting-to-know-you development, no build-up of heat, no surprise, really. This 500-page book is really 250 pages too long and it all feels stretched out, with long sequences of unnecessary dialogue, superfluous scenes to establish things that already have been established, and so on. Can't help wondering what's going on with Nora Roberts these days. She's written a number of really good books, but her recent books seem like &#34;Nora Roberts diluted&#34;. So-so, at best. Maybe with so many books behind her, she's just burning out. As far as this one goes, I'm glad I got it from the library. If I had paid for it, I'd have been steamed. Maybe if she wrote fewer books each year -- but better ones -- I'd be a happier reader.""",2015-08-31,negaitve,August,Monday,2015

As a medical student, I concur with the other reviews that this is an excellent introductory resource to obtain foundation for your clinical education.<br /><br />This review will instead focus on the lecture videos, which supplement each and every chapter, and can be easily overlooked - and let me tell you, they are great! As someone with experience in designing and producing interactive educational multimedia, here are my takes on the videos:<br /><br />- There is a video lecture that supplements each chapter. They are very nice summaries and place emphasis on the important points in the text while supplementing with interesting points to enhance memorization<br />- There are multiple choice questions immbedded between sections of each lecture, which are great reminders and pointers of key learning points and forced you to think again. Each question comes with a full explanation of choices and main concept.<br />- The videos are short and sweet<br />- They have very similar content to the text, but uses different sensory modalities (i.e. graphs, animations, images, audio) that enhance memorization; for example, for the introductory lecture on the history of anesthesia, the pictures of different historic figures and instruments really helped me link names to events.<br />- As someone with experience in designing and producing educational multimedia projects, I understand how hard it is to have high quality (and actually very useful) digital contents made available to supplement the text. There are inherent restrictions on the different technical parameters allowed by such web contents, such as the definitions and smoothness of the videos. With that in mind, the qualities of the lecture videos are pretty great. The other thing is, while you can switch the slides and lecturer windows, it might be helpful to have an option to change the sizes of different windows (I personally think the lecturer's window is too small).<br/>- I could recommend several good ways to utilize the lecture videos. 1. you can watch the videos after reading the text 2. you can watch the video first, and then you can pause and refer back to the text for clarification if needed - the videos cover the main points. 3. read the text of every chapter, then when reviewing the concepts at the end of your study, use the lecture videos.<br /><br />In summary, great videos! And if you bought this book or planning on getting this book (yes you will like it if you are a medical student learning anesthesia or a resident looking to lay down good foundational knowledge), make sure you USE these wonderful interactive digital contents!""",2015-08-31,positive,August,Monday,2015

He is a keen observer, a consumer of origins, fine distinctions, continua, grand schemes, and minute details. He likely began observing and contemplating information from the moment he experienced the glare of light in the delivery room, and he has never stopped. Interestingly, while THE MIND is about the remarkable way John thinks, it speaks to the larger questions of how we all think, how we came to be sapient in the first place, and how we develop as thinking souls in space and time. Keeping the language of his prose-like tercets basic, unadorned, and free-flowing, he accomplishes poetry of significance and elemental beauty. Left brain contemplation of structure and systems aligns itself with right brain wonder and whimsy, but neither hemisphere dominates in the work, so the reader can only expect the unexpected. And the rewards are great: poems of curiosity, orientation with the universe, sorrow, finding center, and surprising hilarity. (Only John can make the idea of rocks funny.) If I were teaching from John's book, I would encourage poetry students to examine his masterful skill with personification. I would encourage philosophy students to wrestle with his experiences of phenomena. I would ask psychology and neuro-biology candidates to experience the brain from inside-out. I would ask physics students to explore how we process space and time in an era when such concepts are continually challenged and updated. I would ask divinity students to consider creation from the point of view of the created. THE MIND weighs so many approaches to thinking and being that you won't devour it in one or two sittings. Read it as you would the Book of Genesis, or Hawking, or an introduction to meditation. You will not think the same way ever again after reading it.""",2015-08-31,positive,August,Monday,2015

I actually got this book in the hopes to understand my friend's son who's got autism spectrum, and also to help my friend on how to cope with her son, Brent. Together, we read the book to him, and thoroughly explained the stuffs he needs to do with his body while growing up. I like that the book also contains important information and advice for parents and guardians in order to properly provide for the physical and emotional well-being of the kids. He's learning a lot, thanks to the valuable pieces of information as well as the illustrations in the book.
